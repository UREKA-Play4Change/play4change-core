# Play4Change — Known Hacks & Technical Debt

## Format

A hack is any place in the code where the implementation is not the right solution —
it is a shortcut, stub, workaround, or temporary measure.

Every hack must be tracked here until it is fixed. When a hack is fixed, mark it as
FIXED with the phase and commit reference. Do not delete fixed entries.

**Entry format:**
```
## [ID] [OPEN|FIXED] — [Short title]

**Location:** [file:line or package]
**What it is:** [Describe the hack clearly — what is wrong with this code]
**Why it exists:** [Why the hack was introduced — time pressure, missing dependency, etc.]
**Fix:** [What the correct solution is]
**Fix in:** [Phase and task number where this is scheduled to be fixed]
**Fixed:** [If FIXED: phase, task, commit hash]
```

## H01 [FIXED] — CI JDK version mismatch (17 vs 21)

**Location:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml:14` (the `java-version` field in `setup-java` step)

**What it is:** The CI workflow runs on JDK 17, but the server Gradle build targets JVM 21
(`jvmToolchain(21)` in `server/build.gradle.kts`). This means CI compiles and tests against
an older JVM than the target runtime. Language features and optimisations available in JVM 21
are not exercised in CI.

**Why it exists:** The CI was scaffolded early and the JVM version was not updated when the
server module set its toolchain target.

**Fix:** Change `.github/workflows/ci.yml` `java-version: '17'` to `java-version: '21'`.
Use `distribution: 'temurin'`.

**Fix in:** Phase 01, Task 1.2

**Fixed:** Phase 01, Task 1.2 — changed `java-version` from `'17'` to `'21'` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## H02 [FIXED] — Name.kt and Password.kt value object stubs

**Location:** `server/src/main/kotlin/*/domain/model/Name.kt`,
`server/src/main/kotlin/*/domain/model/Password.kt` (exact paths may vary — search for these files)

**What it is:** These value objects accept any string without validation. A `Name` constructed
from an empty string or a 1000-character control-character string is indistinguishable from a
valid name in the domain model. `Password.kt` may be unused entirely. Neither class enforces
any invariant.

**Why it exists:** They were scaffolded as stubs when the domain model was initially built
and were never completed before the auth system was added on top.

**Fix:**
- `Name`: validate non-blank, length 2–100, no control characters. Return `Either<NameError, Name>`.
- `Password`: if unused, delete the file. If used, implement: ≥12 chars, uppercase, digit,
  special character. Validate on construction.
- Write unit tests for both.

**Fix in:** Phase 01, Task 1.4

**Fixed:** Phase 01, Task 1.4, commit cc798c4 — Name.kt validates non-blank, 2–100 chars, no control characters. Password.kt deleted (unused).

## H04 [OPEN] — dep-check Gradle plugin unusable locally; CI uses CLI action instead

**Location:** `server/build.gradle.kts` (plugin declaration), `.github/workflows/dependency-check.yml` (CI workaround)

**What it is:** `org.owasp.dependencycheck:10.0.4` Gradle plugin has a Jackson version mismatch bug.
The plugin was compiled against `jackson-annotations:2.17+` (which has `JsonFormat.Feature.READ_DATE_TIMESTAMPS_AS_NANOSECONDS`)
but its own Gradle plugin classpath resolves `jackson-annotations:2.14.2` via Gradle's isolated
plugin classloader. The result is a `NoSuchFieldError` at task execution time.

`configurations.all.resolutionStrategy.force()` cannot fix this — it applies to project configurations,
not Gradle's plugin classloader (which is separately isolated). Changing JDK from 24 → 21 does not
help either; the isolation is independent of JDK version.

**Why it exists:** dep-check 10.0.4 was released with an incorrect dependency declaration in its POM
(declared 2.14.2, compiled against 2.17). Older versions (8.x) use deprecated NVD legacy feeds that
now return 403 Forbidden. No current dep-check Gradle plugin version works without this conflict on
this project setup (Spring BOM + LangChain4j BOM + Gradle 8.14.3).

**Fix:** Wait for OWASP dep-check to release a version with aligned Jackson dependency declarations
(compiled version == declared version ≥ 2.17). When that version is released, update
`server/build.gradle.kts` plugin version and remove the `copyRuntimeDependencies` task.

**Fix in:** Unscheduled — depends on upstream dep-check release.

**Workaround in CI:** `.github/workflows/dependency-check.yml` uses `dependency-check/Dependency-Check_Action@main`
which runs dep-check CLI directly (no Gradle plugin mechanism, no classloader conflict). The CLI
scans JARs copied by the `copyRuntimeDependencies` Gradle task.

## H03 [OPEN] — All mobile repositories mocked (Ktor not wired)

**Location:** `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/*/data/` — all `Mock*Repository.kt` files

**What it is:** Every repository in the KMP mobile client is a mock implementation.
The `MockAuthRepository`, `MockTopicRepository`, `MockEnrollmentRepository`,
`MockStruggleRepository`, `MockPeerReviewRepository`, `MockProfileRepository`, and
`MockBadgeRepository` return hardcoded or randomly delayed fake data. No real HTTP calls
are made to the server.

**Why it exists:** The mobile client UI was built against mocks to allow frontend development
to proceed independently of backend development. This is the correct approach for parallel
development — the hack is that the wiring to real HTTP was never done.

**Fix:** Replace each mock repository with an `Http*Repository` implementation using Ktor
`HttpClient`. Implement `TokenStorage` with `EncryptedSharedPreferences` (Android) and
Keychain (iOS). Implement 401→refresh→retry logic.

**Fix in:** Phase 04, Tasks 4.1–4.5

**Fixed:** *(to be filled when task is complete)*
